# Week 1 - Orange and Blue
### Description

Orange and blue are opposites? They are! It's particularly obvious when you look at them exactly across from each other on the color wheel. But they also feel so different. The warm orange glow of the sun versus the cold presence of the ocean or night sky. Can you embrace this clash with a design featuring these two colors?
